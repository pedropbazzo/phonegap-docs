In order to submit your PhoneGap apps to the app stores, they need to be signed. iOS apps must be signed with a Developer Certificate to be built at all; they must be signed with a Distributions Certificate to be submitted to the App store. Android and Windows apps can be built and run without signing during development, but must be signed for distribution. This process varies across platforms, see the individual platform tabs for details.

<div class="alert--warning">**Note**: it is Phonegap Build's policy not to retrieve signing keys for users, for legal reasons. Please back them up.</div>
